### What is a community?

Communities are user-created areas of interest, to discuss and post on a common theme and topic.

With the help of community, one can broadcast and push his content to those who are interested in the related topic of the community being posted. Which helps the creator to find other sharing similar interests, to whom they can follow in return.

By joining, communities of your choice , one creates a unique feed made up of posts from the joined communities, thus giving you feed free from unwanted posts and focused only on your interests.

The members of the community shape the community. Community's allow others to feel like they are a part of something, a similar taste, a similar likings, similar experiences.

Your community settings consist of 5 tabs

The first of them is the Appearance settings, where you can manage your community's name, description, and images

On the second tab, you are able to invite moderators. A moderator has the power to ban users, hide publications breaking the rules, and modify the rules.

The next tab is the "Members" tab, where you can ban users who are breaking the rules of your community. After you ban a person, all of their previous publications under the community will be hidden. This is also the page you would navigate to in case you need to revoke a ban.

Coming next on the list is the "Reported Posts" tab, where all the posts reported by the community will be displayed. If you believe that the posts actually break the rules, you will have the option to hide them, ban the reported publication creator, or ignore the report if it is irrelevant.

Last but not least, there's the "Rules" tab that will help you communicate the rules to your members so they will understand how to use your community and avoid getting banned. After you save the rules, they will be displayed at all times on the right side of the screen.

A community post is the same as any other regular post, with the difference that it is displayed on the community page and your private page. This means that the publication, like any other, can have collections turned on and be monetized.
